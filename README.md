# Priority Engine

A cognitive instrument for mental clarity.
This is not a task manager. It is a decision-compression engine.

## Philosophy

1.  **Capture**: Dump everything.
2.  **Filter**: Is it urgent? (Break/Expire/Penalize in 24h?)
3.  **Decide**: Pick ONE from the top 5.
4.  **Execute**: Define "Done". Do it.

- **Database**: Dexie.js (IndexedDB) - Local First
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
